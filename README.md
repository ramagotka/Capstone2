# Capstone2

This is a final project for my Android Developer Nanodegree. 
The project is a scoring sheet for Five Tribes boardgame. It includes two ways of scoring,
a traditional one at the end of game, and advanced way after every turn,
allowing comparison of moves between players. 

The app also features tracking and comparing player scores and statistics of point distribution between different types of moves, to enable users to improve their play.

Project includes widget, showing piechart of players leaderboard.
